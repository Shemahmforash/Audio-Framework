/**
 * Receives a plot and a decoder and plays back the audio from the decoder at
 * the same time as it sets the marker in the plot accordingly. The marker
 * position is calculated in pixels by measuring the elapsed time between the
 * start of the playback and the current time. The elapsed time is then
 * multiplied by the frequency divided by the sample window size (1024 samples
 * in this case). This gives us the x-coordinate of the marker in the plot.
 * After writting a sample window to the audio device and setting the marker we
 * sleep for 20ms to give the Swing GUI thread time to repaint the plot with the
 * updated marker position.
